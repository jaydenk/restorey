# Restorey

A free, open-source macOS menu bar app that puts an Arq/Backblaze-style front end on
[restic](https://restic.net).

> **Status: design stage.** There is no app to download yet. The design is approved and the
> platform spike is done ([findings](docs/spike-findings.md)); v0.1 engine work has begun with the project scaffold.
> Nothing here is ready to protect your data.

## What it will do

- Show backup status in the menu bar, with live progress, Back Up Now and Pause.
- Run backups from a background agent, so they keep running with the app closed and catch up after sleep.
- Support several independent backup plans, each with its own repository, sources, schedule and retention.
- Adopt existing restic repositories without losing their history.
- Restore files through a Time Machine-style window: Finder columns plus a timeline of snapshots.
- Alert loudly when backups fail or stop, through macOS notifications, a Healthchecks-style check-in URL, ntfy, Pushover or a webhook.
- Verify repositories regularly with `restic check` and test restores.
- Support cold storage plans on S3 Glacier Deep Archive, with a guided thaw before restoring.

Restorey is a thin wrapper. restic does the deduplication, encryption, storage and retention.

It is aimed at people who already know restic. It targets macOS 27 and will not be on the Mac App Store,
because the App Store sandbox rules out the Full Disk Access a backup tool needs.

## Building from source

Prerequisites: macOS 27, Xcode 27 and [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`).

1. Fetch the pinned upstream binaries (restic 0.19.1 and rest-server 0.14.0, checked against each release's
   `SHA256SUMS`) into the gitignored `vendor/` folder:

   ```sh
   scripts/fetch-binaries.sh
   ```

2. Run the CI checks: the `RestoreyCore` tests, an unsigned Debug build and the bundle checks. If
   `Config/Local.xcconfig` exists, it also does a signed Debug build and the full signature checks.

   ```sh
   scripts/ci.sh
   ```

3. For a signed local install, copy `Config/Local.example.xcconfig` to `Config/Local.xcconfig` (gitignored) and
   set `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`. Then build, sign and install `RestoreyDev.app` into `/Applications`:

   ```sh
   scripts/install-dev.sh
   ```

Debug builds use a separate identity (`com.jaydenkerr.restorey.dev`, `RestoreyDev`), so they can sit beside a
Release install without sharing a launchd label, keychain group or on-disk state. GitHub Actions runs the
unsigned path of `scripts/ci.sh` on every push and pull request.

## Why the keychain tests need a signed host

Restorey keeps every repository password, backend key and check-in URL in the data protection keychain
(design spec §7 and §10), never the legacy file keychain that `/usr/bin/security` can read. The data
protection keychain only works for code that carries the `keychain-access-groups` entitlement, which needs a
signed app with a provisioning profile. Under bare `swift test` there is no such app, so `SecItemAdd` and
`SecItemCopyMatching` fail with `-34018` (`errSecMissingEntitlement`). Dropping `kSecUseDataProtectionKeychain`
in tests would pass but test the wrong keychain, so the keychain tests are not in `RestoreyCore`'s package suite.

They live in the `AgentHostedTests` bundle, which runs inside the signed Debug agent
(`xcodebuild test -scheme AgentHostedTests -configuration Debug`). `scripts/ci.sh` runs them only when
`Config/Local.xcconfig` exists. On GitHub Actions it doesn't, and the script prints
`hosted keychain tests skipped: no signing` instead. The tests use a random plan ID each and delete what they
create, so they never touch real Restorey items. The hosted build goes in `~/Library/Caches/restorey-ci`
(override with `RESTOREY_HOSTED_DERIVED_DATA`), not `build/`, because macOS blocks launching an app from
`~/Documents` on a privacy prompt that nobody is there to answer.

## Restoring without Restorey

Your backups will always be plain restic repositories. If Restorey ever disappears, you can restore with
the restic command-line tool and the details from your recovery kit. Full instructions will be added here
before the first release.
